== stats-beta.sh ==

Generate the diff between to beta versions.

For example:
scripts/stats-beta.sh ~/dev/mozilla/beta-src FIREFOX_39_0b1_RELEASE FIREFOX_39_0b2_RELEASE > _posts/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")-fx-39-b1-to-b2.md

Will generate the diff between beta 1 and beta 2 of Firefox 39.

For RC release, checkout the release branch and run:
scripts/stats-beta.sh ~/dev/mozilla/release-src FIREFOX_39_0b9_RELEASE FIREFOX_39_0_BUILD1 > _posts/$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")-fx-39-b9-to-rc.md

(don't forget that fennec does not have a RC version, beta 10 instead)

The Firefox 34 release date will move out one week from Nov 25 to Dec 1/2. This change impacts Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android, Firefox ESR, and Thunderbird.<br />The purpose of this change is to allow for an additional week of stabilization during the 34 cycle.

Details of the change:
<ul>
<li>Release date change from Nov 25 to Dec 1/2 (need to determine the date that works best given the work week)</li>
<li>Merge date change from Tue, Nov 24 to Fri, Nov 28</li>
<li>Two additional desktop betas (10 and 11) will be added to the calendar this week on our usual beta build schedule (build Mon and Thu, release Tue and Fri)</li>
<li>One additional mobile beta (beta 11) will be added to the schedule.<br />Note that mobile beta 10 will gtb on schedule on Mon.<br />Mobile beta 11 will gtb on Thu with desktop in order to be ready early the following week.</li>
<li>RC builds will happen on Mon, Nov 24</li>
</ul>
Note that we are effectively moving an extra week that we had previously added to the 35 Beta cycle in the 34 Beta cycle. 35 will have a 7 week Aurora cycle instead of a 7 week Beta cycle.
